# Curl2Scrapy

## Overview
Obviously, this library shares a name with an existing library and online tool, https://github.com/michael-shub/curl2scrapy. Whereas that project is written in Javascript, this is a native Python library which I am not planning to turn into an online widget any time soon. To be clear, it has no code influence from this other library. It is useful because of its ability to be easily integrated with other Scrapy tools, for example, my other Scrapy library, htttps://github.com/ThomasAitken/Scrapy-Testmaster. 

## Usage
There is only one command "curl2scrapy" and it accepts one command line argument, a cURL request enclosed in double quotes.
