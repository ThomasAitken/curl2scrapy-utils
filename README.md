# Curl2Scrapy

## Overview
Obviously, this library has a similar name to an existing library and online
tool, https://github.com/michael-shub/curl2scrapy. My code has some influence from this other
library. There are two differences: this tool better handles complex Form/JSON
requests, and it has a second option for converting cURL commands to a format
that may be executed using the "testmaster parse" command of my other Scrapy library,
htttps://github.com/ThomasAitken/Scrapy-Testmaster.
